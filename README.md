## Overview

Real\_Estate is built using **Next.js**, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. This project aims to provide users with a clean and responsive interface to browse real estate listings, filter properties based on type, price, or location, and get detailed information with images, descriptions, and contact options.

Key objectives of the project:

* Demonstrate a modern Next.js workflow and best practices
* Build a responsive and interactive user interface
* Optimize font loading using `next/font` for better performance
* Provide a structure that can be easily extended for real-world applications

## Folder Structure

The project uses a clean structure to separate components, pages, and styles:

```
Real_Estate/
├─ app/
│  ├─ page.tsx        # Main homepage component
│  ├─ layout.tsx      # App layout
├─ components/        # Reusable UI components
├─ styles/            # Global and component-specific styles
├─ public/            # Static assets like images and fonts
├─ package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
├─ tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration
└─ next.config.js     # Next.js configuration
```

* **app/page.tsx**: Main entry point that renders the homepage and property listings.
* **components/**: Contains components like `PropertyCard`, `Header`, and `Footer` for modular design.
* **styles/**: Contains CSS or Tailwind files to style individual components and pages.
